    <h2>Proposition: Restrictive state policies and clinic closures lead to a decline in abortion rates.</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			<figure>
				<img src="image1.png" alt="Bar chart showing abortion rates in nonrestrictive vs. restrictive states." />
				<figcaption>
					This bar chart compares the average abortion rates per 1,000 women in states with nonrestrictive versus restrictive policies. The visualization emphasizes that states with more clinics and fewer abortion restrictions tend to have higher abortion rates.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
	
			<h4><strong>Design Decisions and Rationale: </h4></strong> 

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Data Transformation: Categorization, Aggregation, and Outlier Removal (-1, Somewhat Deceptive)</strong>  
					<ul>
						<li> The dataset originally contained abortion rates and clinic availability percentages for individual states. Instead of displaying a state-by-state breakdown, I categorized states as "Restrictive" or "Nonrestrictive" based on whether more than 50% of counties lacked a known abortion clinic.</li>
						<li>To highlight the overall trend, I computed the mean abortion rate per 1,000 women for each policy category rather than showing individual state values. This approach makes the data easier to digest for broader audiences.  </li>
						<li>However, I removed certain outlier states from the restrictive category because their higher abortion rates were increasing the average, making the restrictive policy impact appear less dramatic. By excluding these states, the difference between restrictive and nonrestrictive states appears larger, subtly reinforcing the argument.  </li>
						<li>Alternative Consideration: A scatter plot of abortion rates versus clinic availability with all states included would provide a more comprehensive view but might weaken the visual impact of the comparison.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Emotional Framing (-1.5, Significantly Deceptive)</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The annotation uses emotionally charged language ("600,000 lives lost") to frame the discussion in moral rather than data-driven terms. This phrase implies a moral judgment rather than a neutral presentation of statistics.</li>
						<li>The image of a fetus with a prohibition symbol reinforces an anti-abortion stance, directing the viewer’s emotional response rather than encouraging independent analysis.</li>
						<li>The large red arrow visually amplifies the difference between the two bars, making the gap appear more alarming. This draws attention to the difference without accounting for other influencing factors, such as population differences, healthcare access, or socio-economic factors.</li>
						<li>The annotation is placed strategically near the tallest bar, ensuring the viewer notices it immediately, guiding them to a conclusion before they have time to critically assess the data.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Color Choice and Emotional Framing (-0.5, Slightly Deceptive)</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The red and green color scheme plays into psychological associations: red (danger, urgency) and green (safety, success). This reinforces the idea that restrictive policies are “good” and nonrestrictive ones are “bad.”</li>
						<li>Alternative Consideration: A more neutral color palette (e.g., shades of blue) could reduce bias, but the emotional appeal strengthens persuasion.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Axis Scaling and Data Simplification (-0.5, Somewhat Deceptive)</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The y-axis starts at 3 instead of 0, subtly exaggerating the difference between nonrestrictive and restrictive states by making the bars appear farther apart (without being visible). </li>
						<li>The upper limit of the y-axis perfectly aligns with the tallest bar, ensuring that the gap between nonrestrictive and restrictive states appears maximized while avoiding an extreme truncation that would be too obvious.</li>
						<li>Alternative Consideration: A more complete dataset, including these additional factors, could provide a fuller picture but might weaken the argument.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Title Framing and Certainty (-1, Slightly Deceptive)</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The title "Abortion Rates Are Higher in States with More Clinics." implies causation rather than correlation. It suggests that increased clinic availability causes higher abortion rates, when in reality, both could be influenced by other external factors (such as population size, demand, or overall healthcare access).</li>
						<li>Alternative: A more neutral title such as "Abortion Rates Vary by State Policy Type" would be more accurate but less persuasive.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Added Citation and Its Role (+2, Earnest Use of Citation)</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The added citation to Hasstedt, Sonfield, and Gold (2017) [1] enhances the credibility of the claim by linking it to a published report rather than presenting the data without support. This transparency balances out some of the more deceptive techniques used in the visualization.</li>

					</ul>

      <h3><strong> AGAINST the Proposition</strong></h3>

        <figure>
					<img src="image2.png" alt="Bar chart showing in-state and out-of-state abortion rates by state policy type." />
				<figcaption>
					This stacked bar chart breaks down abortion rates in restrictive vs. nonrestrictive states, showing both in-state (blue) and out-of-state (gray) procedures. The visualization highlights that restrictive policies do not necessarily lower total abortion rates but instead shift them across state lines, as seen in the 53% increase in out-of-state abortions among women from restrictive states. The airplane icons reinforce the idea of travel for abortion care. 
				<figcaption>
		</figure>

			<p>
				<strong>Design Decisions and Rationale: </strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Data Contextualization and Framing (+1.5, Mostly Earnest)</strong>  
					<ul>
						<li>This visualization includes both in-state and out-of-state abortions, adding context that was missing in the first visualization. By presenting a more complete picture, it reduces the potential for misleading interpretations.</li>
						<li>The airplane icons serve as a subtle but effective way to indicate that individuals are traveling for abortions, reinforcing the claim that restrictions lead to cross-state travel rather than reducing overall abortion rates.</li>
						<li>Alternative Consideration: The visualization could include absolute numbers instead of just rates to provide a clearer picture of how many people are actually traveling out of state.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Data Transformation: Categorization and Segmentation (+1, Mostly Earnest)</strong>  
					<ul>
						<li>The dataset originally provided total abortion rates by state. Instead of showing state-by-state data, I categorized states into "Restrictive" and "Nonrestrictive" groups based on policy type, similar to the first visualization.</li>
						<li>To differentiate where abortions were performed, I segmented the data into two components: "In-State Abortions" and "Out-of-State Abortions". The latter was calculated as a percentage of total abortions based on state-level out-of-state travel data.</li>
						<li>This transformation highlights how restrictive policies shift access across state lines rather than reducing total abortions, making it a critical element of the argument.</li>
						<li>Alternative Consideration: A state-by-state comparison with absolute numbers might provide a more detailed perspective but would be harder to interpret at a glance.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Color Choices and Legibility (+1, Mostly Earnest)</strong>  
					<ul>
						<li>The use of blue and gray is more neutral compared to the emotionally charged red-green scheme in the first visualization.</li>
						<li>The contrast between in-state (blue) and out-of-state (gray) abortions makes it clear that people are still obtaining abortions, just in different locations. This choice helps convey the argument without excessive manipulation.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Title Framing and Statistical Highlighting (-0.5, Slightly Deceptive)</strong>  
					<ul>
						<li>The title "Abortion Rates Shift Across State Lines in Response to Restrictions" suggests a direct causal link between restrictions and increased out-of-state travel. While there is strong evidence to support this claim, correlation does not always equal causation.</li>
						<li>The annotation "53% increase in out-of-state abortions" is bolded in red, ensuring it draws immediate attention. This is a persuasive tactic, though it is not inherently deceptive.</li>
						<li>Alternative Consideration: A less assertive title like "Abortion Rates Vary by State Policy Type" would be more neutral but would also weaken the persuasive power of the visualization.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li><strong>Use of Citation (+2, Earnest Use of Citation)</strong>  
					<ul>
						<li>The visualization includes a citation to research by Maddow-Zimet and Kost (2021), strengthening its credibility. This transparency allows viewers to verify the claim independently, making the visualization more trustworthy.</li>
						<li>While the framing of the data leans toward persuasion, citing a reputable source ensures that the visualization is not purely manipulative. Providing a link to the report further enhances credibility and ethical responsibility.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>This assignment really highlighted how much design choices can shape how people interpret data. One of the easier parts was deciding how to frame each visualization to support one side of the argument—things like color, labels, and annotations all played a big role in guiding the reader’s perspective. What was more challenging was figuring out how far to push those choices before they crossed into being misleading. For example, in the first visualization, removing outliers from the restrictive category made the difference between the two groups seem larger, which made the argument more compelling but also less neutral. On the other hand, in the second visualization, showing both in-state and out-of-state abortions gave a fuller picture, but I had to think carefully about how to highlight the increase in travel without overstating the effect.
		<br><br>
		This exercise made me realize that there’s no such thing as a completely neutral visualization—every choice, from the title to the scale of the axes, influences how the data is perceived. The key distinction between persuasion and deception seems to come down to intent and subtlety. Using design elements to make an argument is fair, as long as the data itself is not misrepresented. But things like truncated axes, exaggerated claims, or selectively filtering data can cross into manipulation. Ethical visualization, to me, means being aware of these choices and making sure the audience has enough context to think critically about what they’re seeing.</p>
